^CMake Warning \(dev\):
  Policy CMP0058 behavior is triggered: Ninja requires custom command
  byproducts to be explicit.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0058" for policy
  details.

  This policy was introduced in CMake 3.3.0 and issues a warning regardless
  of the policy setting.  For third party users of this software, the command
  line option -Wno-dev may be used to suppress this warning.

  This project specifies custom command DEPENDS on files in the build tree
  that are not specified as the OUTPUT or BYPRODUCTS of any
  add_custom_command or add_custom_target:

   byproduct1a
   byproduct1b

  For compatibility with versions of CMake that did not have the BYPRODUCTS
  option, CMake is generating phony rules for such files to convince 'ninja'
  to build.

  Project authors should add the missing BYPRODUCTS or OUTPUT options to the
  custom commands that produce these files.
