CMake Warning \(dev\) at CMP0057-OLD.cmake:5 \(if\):
  Policy CMP0057 behavior is triggered: Support new IN_LIST if\(\) operator.
  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0057" for policy details.

  This policy was introduced in CMake 3.3.0 and issues a warning regardless
  of the policy setting.  For third party users of this software, the command
  line option -Wno-dev may be used to suppress this warning.

  IN_LIST will be interpreted as an operator when the policy is set to NEW.
  Since the policy is not set to NEW, the OLD behavior will be used.
