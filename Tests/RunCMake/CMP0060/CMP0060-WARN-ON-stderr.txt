^CMake Warning \(dev\) at CMP0060-Common.cmake:[0-9]+ \(add_executable\):
  Policy CMP0060 behavior is triggered: Link libraries by full path even in
  implicit directories.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0060" for policy
  details.

  This policy was introduced in CMake 3.3.0 and issues a warning regardless
  of the policy setting.  For third party users of this software, the command
  line option -Wno-dev may be used to suppress this warning.

  Some library files are in directories implicitly searched by the linker
  when invoked for C:

   .*/Tests/RunCMake/CMP0060/CMP0060-WARN-ON-build/lib/(lib)?CMP0060.(a|lib)

  For compatibility with older versions of CMake, the generated link line
  will ask the linker to search for these by library name.
