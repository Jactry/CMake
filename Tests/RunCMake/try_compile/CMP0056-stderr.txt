CMake Warning \(dev\) at CMP0056.cmake:[0-9]+ \(try_compile\):
  Policy CMP0056 behavior is triggered: Honor link flags in try_compile\(\)
  source-file signature.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0056" for policy
  details.

  This policy was introduced in CMake 3.2.0 and issues a warning regardless
  of the policy setting.

  For compatibility with older versions of CMake, try_compile is not honoring
  caller link flags \(e.g.  CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS\) in the test project.
